# AgriSecure

Crop raiding is a major problem faced by farmers having farm lands near forests. Several methods like fencing, repellents, etc have been practised by the farmers to drive away animals.Our idea is to implement such a system for preventing animal encroachment to the farm in an efficient and cheap method. This proposed system contains multiple thermal imaging cameras that work hand-in-hand with a raspberry pi,which assesses the footage for animal encroachment and takes the necessary steps for driving it away safely using an ultrasonic sound generator. The system also uses LoRaWAN and can also be made capable of giving live updates to the farmer about any kind of issues in the farmland.

## Problem Statement
<br/>
**To solve the ever increasing problem of animal encroachment to human cultivated land and vegetation, instead of unethical and inefficient practices followed by local farmers, we try to bring in the most economical and eco-friendly design of a system ensuring 100% protection of the vegetation and safety of the animal.**
